## About

In this workshop, participants will:

- Learn the fundamentals of agentic AI and autonomous systems.
- Implement basic agent models.
- Explore key challenges in decision-making, ethics, and safety in AI.
- Engage in hands-on coding exercises to apply theoretical concepts.

The workshop is structured to guide participants from foundational knowledge to more complex, real-world applications.

## Workshop Structure

1. **Introduction to Agentic AI**  
   Understanding the basic concepts and applications of agentic AI.
   
2. **Building Autonomous Agents**  
   Hands-on coding session to create simple agent models using [preferred programming language or framework].
   
3. **AI Ethics and Safety**  
   Discuss the ethical implications and safety measures in deploying agentic AI systems.
   
4. **Advanced Topics**  
   Explore more complex topics such as reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and interpretability.
